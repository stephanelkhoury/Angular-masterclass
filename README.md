# Angular Masterclass: Zero to Hero

A comprehensive, structured learning path for mastering Angular framework. This repository contains 25 chapters, each focused on a specific aspect of Angular development to help you learn modern web application development with Angular.

## What is Angular?

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It's developed and maintained by Google and offers a comprehensive solution for front-end development with features like:

- Component-based architecture
- Powerful templating system
- Robust routing
- Form handling
- State management
- Dependency injection
- Testing utilities

## Why Use Angular?

- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built for large-scale applications with maintainability in mind
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed through features like AOT compilation and change detection
- **Cross-Platform**: Build apps for any deployment target including web, mobile web, native mobile, and native desktop
- **Strong Typing**: TypeScript brings static typing, helping catch errors during development
- **Comprehensive**: Everything you need is included in the framework
- **Long-Term Support**: Strong backing from Google with clear update paths
