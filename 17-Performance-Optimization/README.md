# Chapter 17: Performance Optimization

## Introduction

Performance is a key aspect of any Angular application. This chapter covers various techniques and best practices for optimizing Angular applications to ensure they load quickly, respond efficiently to user interactions, and provide a smooth experience across different devices and network conditions.

## Topics Covered

1. **Change Detection**
   - Understanding Angular's change detection mechanism
   - OnPush change detection strategy
   - Optimizing change detection cycles

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Loading modules and components on demand
   - PreloadingStrategy for better user experience
   - Custom preloading strategies

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - HTTP request caching
   - Client-side data caching
   - Implementing a caching service

4. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Tree-shaking
   - Code-splitting
   - Build optimization flags

5. **Virtual Scrolling**
   - Handling large lists efficiently
   - Implementing virtual scrolling with Angular CDK
   - Optimizing DOM rendering

6. **Pure Pipes and Memoization**
   - Creating and using pure pipes
   - Memoization techniques
   - Avoiding expensive computations

7. **Web Workers**
   - Moving CPU-intensive tasks to background threads
   - Setting up and using web workers in Angular
   - Sharing data between main thread and workers

8. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - Benefits of Angular Universal
   - Setting up SSR
   - Transfer state between server and client

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` folder contains a complete Angular application with various performance optimization techniques implemented:

- Components with OnPush change detection
- Lazy-loaded feature modules
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Efficient data-fetching strategies
- Caching implementations
- Web worker examples

## Best Practices

- Always use OnPush change detection when possible
- Implement lazy loading for features not needed at startup
- Keep component templates simple
- Optimize images and assets
- Use trackBy with ngFor
- Debounce event handlers for better performance
- Consider virtual scrolling for long lists
