# Chapter 23: Advanced Patterns

## Introduction

As Angular applications grow in complexity, developers need advanced design patterns and architectural approaches to maintain code quality and scalability. This chapter explores advanced patterns that solve common challenges in enterprise-level Angular applications.

## Topics Covered

1. **State Management Patterns**
   - NGRX vs Services
   - State management with BehaviorSubject
   - Implementing the CQRS pattern
   - Event sourcing in Angular

2. **Component Architecture Patterns**
   - Smart vs. Presentational components
   - Container pattern
   - Component facade pattern
   - Compound component pattern

3. **Component Communication Patterns**
   - Observer pattern with RxJS
   - Mediator pattern
   - Event bus implementation
   - Hierarchical state sharing

4. **Form Management Patterns**
   - Dynamic form generation
   - Form builder factory pattern
   - Multi-step form wizards
   - Cross-field validation strategies

5. **Data Access Patterns**
   - Repository pattern
   - Data services with caching
   - Adapters and mappers
   - Offline-first data handling

6. **Higher-Order Components**
   - Creating reusable HOCs
   - Component inheritance vs. composition
   - Decorator pattern for components
   - Mixins in Angular

7. **Domain-Driven Design in Angular**
   - Implementing bounded contexts
   - Aggregates and entities
   - Domain events
   - Value objects and DTOs

8. **Advanced Dependency Injection**
   - Hierarchical injectors
   - Multi-providers
   - Factory providers
   - Custom injector strategies

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` folder contains a comprehensive Angular application demonstrating:

- Implementation of various architectural patterns
- Advanced state management techniques
- Dynamic component creation
- Scalable application structure
- Reusable pattern libraries
- Performance optimizations using advanced patterns

## Best Practices

- Choose patterns based on application needs, not trends
- Document architectural decisions and pattern usage
- Balance flexibility with simplicity
- Create consistent pattern implementations
- Consider testability when implementing patterns
- Use composition over inheritance
- Apply patterns incrementally as complexity demands them
