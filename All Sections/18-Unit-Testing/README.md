# Chapter 18: Unit Testing in Angular

## Introduction

Testing is a critical aspect of developing Angular applications. This chapter covers the fundamentals of unit testing in Angular, focusing on testing components, services, pipes, and directives using the Jasmine testing framework and Karma test runner.

## Topics Covered

1. **Testing Fundamentals**
   - Understanding unit testing principles
   - Setting up the testing environment
   - Jasmine testing framework overview
   - Karma test runner

2. **Testing Angular Components**
   - Component class testing
   - Component template testing
   - Testing component interactions
   - Component fixtures and debugging

3. **Testing Services**
   - Testing service methods
   - Testing HTTP services
   - Mocking dependencies
   - Testing observables and async code

4. **Testing Pipes and Directives**
   - Testing pure and impure pipes
   - Testing attribute directives
   - Testing structural directives

5. **Advanced Testing Techniques**
   - Testing components with dependencies
   - Testing components with inputs and outputs
   - Testing router navigation
   - Testing forms and validation

6. **Test Doubles**
   - Spies
   - Stubs
   - Mocks
   - Fakes

7. **Testing Best Practices**
   - Organizing tests
   - Writing maintainable tests
   - Test coverage
   - Continuous integration

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` folder contains practical examples of unit tests for:

- Components with various complexity levels
- Services with HTTP calls and dependencies
- Custom pipes and directives
- Forms (template-driven and reactive)
- Router components

## Best Practices

- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
- Keep tests small, focused, and independent
- Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test edge cases and failure scenarios
- Aim for high code coverage, but prioritize critical paths
- Avoid testing framework code (Angular itself)
