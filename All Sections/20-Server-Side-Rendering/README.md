# Chapter 20: Server-Side Rendering with Angular Universal

## Introduction

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique that enables rendering Angular applications on the server instead of in the browser. This chapter covers Angular Universal, the official SSR solution for Angular applications. SSR offers significant benefits for performance, SEO, and user experience, particularly for content-heavy applications.

## Topics Covered

1. **SSR Fundamentals**
   - What is Server-Side Rendering
   - Benefits of SSR vs Client-Side Rendering
   - How Angular Universal works
   - Trade-offs and when to use SSR

2. **Setting Up Angular Universal**
   - Adding Universal to an existing project
   - Configuring server-side rendering
   - Running in development mode
   - Managing environment variables

3. **Handling Browser APIs in SSR**
   - Dealing with window, document, and localStorage
   - Platform detection with PLATFORM_ID
   - Universal patterns for DOM manipulation
   - Using TransferState for browser APIs

4. **Data Transfer between Server and Browser**
   - Using TransferState to avoid duplicate data fetching
   - State transfer strategies
   - Managing cookies and sessions

5. **Deployment and Performance**
   - Production deployment options
   - Prerendering static routes
   - Caching strategies
   - Performance optimization techniques

6. **Advanced SSR Topics**
   - Handling authentication in SSR
   - Dynamic meta tags for SEO
   - Server-side events and WebSockets
   - Hybrid rendering approaches

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` folder contains a complete Angular application with:

- Basic Angular Universal setup
- Data fetching strategies for SSR
- SEO optimization techniques
- Meta tag management
- TransferState implementations
- Platform-specific code handling
- Prerendering configuration

## Best Practices

- Use platform detection for browser-specific APIs
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation in components
- Implement TransferState to prevent duplicate data fetching
- Keep server-side rendering fast (< 200ms)
- Apply appropriate caching strategies
- Prerender static routes when possible
- Use SSR where it provides the most value (public, content-focused pages)
