# Chapter 16: Angular Modules

## Introduction

Angular modules are containers for different parts of your application. They help organize code into cohesive functionality blocks and provide boundaries within your application. This chapter explores the concept of Angular modules, their benefits, and how to leverage them for better code organization and maintainability.

## Topics Covered

1. **Angular Module Basics**
   - What are Angular modules
   - The root AppModule
   - Declarations, imports, exports, and providers

2. **Feature Modules**
   - Creating feature modules
   - Organizing code by feature
   - Lazy loading feature modules

3. **Shared Modules**
   - Creating reusable shared modules
   - Best practices for shared modules

4. **Core Module**
   - Single-instance services
   - Application-wide components
   - Guards and interceptors

5. **Lazy Loading**
   - Benefits of lazy loading
   - Setting up routes for lazy loading
   - PreloadingStrategies

6. **NgModules vs. Standalone Components**
   - Comparing approaches
   - When to use each
   - Migration strategies

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` folder contains a complete Angular application demonstrating module organization patterns:

- Feature modules for different application areas
- Shared module with common components
- Core module for application-wide services
- Lazy loading implementation
- Dynamic module loading

## Best Practices

- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Use feature modules to organize related functionality
- Create a shared module for reusable components
- Implement a core module for singleton services
- Use lazy loading for features not needed at application startup
