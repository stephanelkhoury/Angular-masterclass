# Chapter 24: Angular Animations

## Introduction

Animations are a crucial part of modern web applications, enhancing user experience and providing visual feedback. This chapter explores Angular's powerful animation system, which is built on Web Animations API and provides a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for creating sophisticated animations.

## Topics Covered

1. **Animation Fundamentals**
   - Angular animation architecture
   - State-based vs. transition animations
   - Animation timing functions
   - Animation sequencing

2. **Basic Animations**
   - Setting up the animations module
   - Creating fade-in/fade-out effects
   - Slide and scale animations
   - Rotation and transformation

3. **State-Based Animations**
   - Defining states with `state()`
   - Transitions between states
   - Using wildcards in transitions
   - Multi-step state changes

4. **Advanced Transitions**
   - Animation curves and timing
   - Staggered animations
   - Parallel and sequential animations
   - Keyframes for complex animations

5. **Animation Callbacks**
   - Start and done events
   - Controlling animations with code
   - Animation metadata
   - Disabling animations conditionally

6. **Route Transitions**
   - Animating between routes
   - Page transition strategies
   - Shared element transitions
   - Advanced route animation patterns

7. **Performance Considerations**
   - Hardware acceleration
   - Animating with `transform` and `opacity`
   - Animation debugging
   - Testing animations

8. **Reusable Animation Patterns**
   - Creating animation libraries
   - Parametrized animations
   - Composable animations
   - Cross-browser animation handling

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` folder contains a complete Angular application with:

- Basic to advanced animation demonstrations
- Interactive animation playground
- Route transition examples
- Animation performance comparisons
- Reusable animation libraries
- Mobile-friendly animations

## Best Practices

- Use animations purposefully to enhance UX, not distract
- Keep animations short and performant (under 300ms for UI feedback)
- Use native properties that trigger compositing (`transform`, `opacity`)
- Consider users with motion sensitivity
- Include animation disabling options
- Test animations on low-powered devices
- Ensure animations work across browsers
